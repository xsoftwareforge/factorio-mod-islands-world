# Islands World
*Many small islands with dependable starting resources on the spawn island.*

## At a glance
- **Preset:** "Many islands" (`kap_islands`).
- **Guaranteed start:** iron, copper, stone, and coal on the spawn island.
- **Auto land patches:** creates land if needed so ores do not spawn in water.
- **Keeps trying:** checks new chunks until all four resources are present.

## Quick start
1. New game: choose the map-gen preset "Many islands".
2. Existing save: run `/enable_islands_world` once to switch elevation and place missing starting resources.

## Compatibility
- Factorio 2.0
- Locales: en, ja

## Notes
- No new items or recipes; only map-gen and starting resources.
- The command is only needed once per save.
